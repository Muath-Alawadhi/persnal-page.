<h3>About me</h3>
        
  <p> My name is Muath Alawadhi. I am from Yemen and I am 18. Almost a year has passed since I moved to Scotland. I was studying English at Kilmarnock college in Ayrshire. The goal of my career is to be one of the best ethical hackers in Scotland. Moreover, I want to learn coding and I am doing my project of Code  Your Future to get into this course. I'm very interested in tech because today technology is everything. In addition to this, since everything around us is tech, I am intrigued by how that works and how the computer languages can make and change a lot of things in our tech.At the moment, one of my goals is to study the course with Code your future.</p>

    <h4>CODE YOUR FUTURE</h4>
